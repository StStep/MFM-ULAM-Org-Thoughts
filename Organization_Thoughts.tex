\chapter{Overview}

I've mostly been focusing on allocation, organization and data routing. 
Treating them as all highly linked. 

Spent time going down different paths:


\section{Organization}


\subsection{Cell-Organism Hierarchy}

Elements are stuff
Heavily allocation based
Need boundaries
Hierarchical, River and Trees
Macro and micro design levels


\subsection{Agent}

Elements are agents
Open floor plan, so to speak
Negative space okay
Single design level


\section{Allocation}

Tiles are resource
Segmented vs Unified

\subsection{Segmented}

allocation a segment at a time, static borders

+ World is made up of allocation grid, made of mostly equal size segments
+ Segments allocate in entirety 
+ Segment could be routing, or processing, etc


+ Dedicated Operation Routes
- perform allocation based on desired operations
- this would make it very regimented
- would have dedicated paths from one operator to another
+ General Purpose Route.
- would have multiple things in each route
- would need some means of pulling things from and adding to
- might want to use a heirarchical organizational system?


\subsection{Unified}

Circle Allocation

Path Allocation

blowing bubbles

+Stem blows bubble with ID N
+Bubble n blows bubble with ID n-1 if no n-1 doesn't exist
+Bubble n dies if n+1 ID can't be found 

diffusing strings

Path Allocation Through Chipping

+ Each circle allocation takes out a chunk
+ Surface that can be eaten is marked
+ 'Mark' is a line that self adjusts
+ Maintainâ€‹s a min and and max length
+ dissolves like acid
+ 3 stage swap


\section{Routing}

Paterns of Movement

+ Walls of path move stream (Cilia)
+ pulsating from end to end (swap lines)
+ destination sends swap lines , determines rate , when there is incoming data

Element Injection

Acts as one element until it escapes or enters cell
Like sabbot or virus protein coating


Relate operation IDs organ IDs etc into map to understand and program the system
Program through parameters?
Think VHDL and signals?

In: A B C E
A+B=C
C/D =F


\section{Data}

\subsection{Codons}
Codons consist of three Pairs, 64 combinations
The sense is used for encoding
- Math occurs independently for pairs within codon
- translation happens before math -> error refresh

+ A - two of three are A (10)
+ C - two of three are C (10)
+ G - two of three are G (10)
+ T - two of three are T (10)
+ Start - two of three are A and C (12)
+ Stop - two of three are G and T (12)


\section{Calculation}


\subsection{Melange}

+ Whenever operand found, the operator moves left if not moves right
+ Should lead to layering of operators in reasonable manner?

Melange of Operators Use data as notepad
Can keep track of past calculations to have a running average on data and calculations

Flicker Element

Flicker between elements conditionally if there is a code size limit
